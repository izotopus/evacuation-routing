By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Public License. To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor.

b. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright, including without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized.

c. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted April 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.

d. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that the Licensor has authority to license.

e. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.

g. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation.

h. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and making Licensed Material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the Licensed Material without regard to time and place.

i. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other substantially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

j. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License.

Section 2 – Scope.

a. License grant.
1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
A. Reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
B. Produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

4. Media and formats; technical modifications. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never creates Adapted Material.

C. No restrictions on downstream recipients. You may not impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material or Adapted Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material or Adapted Material.

6. No Endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored or endorsed by, the Licensor or others.

b. Other rights.
1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the extent necessary to enable You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.
3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other respects the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect royalties.
